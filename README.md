## Potential Integration

I have build two version of the BabyDoge-GPT, both have the same functionalites but one chatbot fix in the full viewport of the screen and another one is the pop-up version, both have same instances and build with APIs, these chatbot's can-be integrated into anywhere either on the complete subdomain of official baby-doge website or the website but with the popup version, but I don't know what the team thinks about it.
